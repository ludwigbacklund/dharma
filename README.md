# Dharma

## Omitted on purpose

The following functionality has been intentionally left out due to time constraints and prioritizing other things.

- Authentication/authorization
- Security in general
- Logging
- Design system
- Testing
- Linting
- Empty states
- Cleaning up unused fields in GraphQL API (they remain to show off what this setup can do)
